        %h5.center SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
        %p.light
          In order to cover the broadest possible spectrum of topics all talk submissions will be reviewed before they are selected.
          %br/
          For your submission to get selected, it is crucial to provide it with a meaningful and sufficient description. The description should give us a brief, clear and concise overview about your presentation or workshop. Your description will be the content comittee's primary source of information to decide about your submission's approval.The lecture part of your talk should not exceed
          %i 45 minutes
          because we want to reserve at least 15 minutes for audience Q&amp;A, as well as for a proper speaker handover.
          %br/

          It is fine with us if your talk has already been held at another conference as long as your content is up to date. It is mandatory to refrain from submitting any company and/or product propaganda.
