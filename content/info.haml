        :markdown
          <p class="light">
          The conference will take place at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne (Kunsthochschule für Medien / KHM).
          The KHM as an art school brings together practice, theories and reflections. It creates a special experimental climate for independent, artistic work.  Between media, around media, or without being defined by any medium in particular, the KHM combines perspectives, methods, research and ‘thinking practises’.
