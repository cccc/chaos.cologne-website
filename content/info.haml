        %h5 Location
        %p.light
          The conference will take place at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne (Kunsthochschule für Medien / KHM).
          The KHM creates a special experimental climate for independent, artistic work.  Between media, around media, as well as without being defined by any medium in particular, the KHM combines perspectives, methods, research and ‘thinking practises’, that cannot be found in this kind of constellation at classic art schools.
